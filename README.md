Little information:
In this repo I will post my different experiments, such as "Attept to create Residual Network", "GoogLeNet", "SegNet based on RestNet", "YOLO algorithm in work" and so on.
Maybe there will be sentence classification, translators, speech recognization, notebooks about RNN,GRU,LSTM and Conv1D.
For today, I posted my scratch ResNet50 that trains on MNIST database.
Soon, I will upload GoogLeNet example, too.
Thank you for reading until end.
Wish you good day and happy hacking for everybody.
